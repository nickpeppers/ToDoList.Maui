# Notes
* Uses Akavache to save tasks
* Auto Saves changes
* Swipe for left/right for more actions (delete, edit task name)
* xUnit test project doesn't always like to behave unload it if need be.
* Had to move all shareable code to a .NET 8 only project for the test project to build/reference it and even then it'll show a bunch of squiggles in VS 2022.
